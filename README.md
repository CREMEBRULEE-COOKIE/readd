• sometimes I put the public chat off so please whisper to interact with me due to being overwhelmed. I am mostly with my friends, but sometimes I'll just sit by myself if I ever felt like a third wheel in between and WILL move away , or just stay quiet - I don't like the feeling of disturbing either of my friends or someone I'm talking to.

• dni list : basic criteria, skin copiers (learn yourself. well, at least ask me for inspiration, or other people as well. it is not cool to copy someone's effort), homophobic, transphobic, ped-phile, some proships, illegal ships/srs.

c+h/cuddles + hide always open to everyone!! pls make yourself comfortable as well. 

status:
away: mostly offtab, mainly used almost for everything
busy: afk, mostly no response. so perhaps you should whisper to interact after I got back

IMPORTANT NOTE: I have MULTIPLE OF SHADES/STYLE. pls do not assume I steal, and I will ask the person I wanted to ask about how they design their characters! some of them perhaps my friends' shadings, and my shades and style mixes as well. ask first though!

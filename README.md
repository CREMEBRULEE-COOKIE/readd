• sometimes I put the public chat off so please whisper to interact with me due to being overwhelmed. I am mostly with my friends, but sometimes I'll just sit by myself if I ever felt like a third wheel in between and WILL move away , or just stay quiet - I don't like the feeling of disturbing either of my friends or someone I'm talking to.
